# Platform engineering 101

## Step 1: OpenShift enablement
The first step to start the workshop is to have a running OpenShift cluster 
available. During the workshop, the OpenShift cluster and its integrations 
will serve as our internal developer platform. There are two ways to obtain an 
OpenShift cluster:
* From the [Red Hat Developers website](https://developers.redhat.com), 
    which offers tutorials, free e-books, and access to a free OpenShift sandbox.
* From a demo environment provided for you.

### Step 1a: Obtain OpenShift through developers.redhat.com
The [Red Hat Developers website](https://developers.redhat.com) 
is Red Hat's central hub for developers, 
offering many resources to build, deploy, and manage applications using 
Red Hat's technologies. It provides access to free e-books,
free tools, downloads, tutorials, 
documentation, and learning paths covering a range of topics like Quarkus, 
cloud-native application development, Kubernetes, 
containers, and AI/ML. Next to that, it offers hands-on labs, interactive guides, 
and insights from 
Red Hat experts. It’s also a gateway to communities, events, and open-source 
projects, making it a comprehensive platform for learning, collaboration, 
and innovation in modern application development.

Last, but not least, it offers a free sandbox, which allows you to start **a free
OpenShift cluster and/or a free OpenShift AI environment**. It is this sandbox that
we will use. 

**Benefits of the sandbox:**
* Free of charge.
* No credit card required.
* OpenShift cluster.
* OpenShift AI platform.

**Drawbacks of the sandbox:**
* Operator framework disabled (i.e., cost control).
* Cluster gets deleted after 30 days, but you can create a new one then.
* Pods get stopped after 12 hours, but you can restart them any time
  (e.g., through the deployment screen in the OpenShift console).

In order to get the OpenShift cluster, you will need to execute the following steps:
1. Go to the [Red Hat Developers website](https://developers.redhat.com).
2. Log in (or create an account).
3. Go to the menu item "Developer Sandbox".
4. Click "Explore the free Developer Sandbox".
5. Click "Start your sandbox for free".
6. Click "Get started" and you will see three available services
   * The OpenShift sandbox.
   * OpenShift dev spaces (an IDE running on OpenShift/Kubernetes), which is accessible through the browser.
   * The OpenShift AI sandbox.
7. Click "Launch" for Red Hat OpenShift.
8. Click Log in with "dev sandbox".

### Step 1b: Obtain OpenShift through a demo environment

## Step 2: Install Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift
To install Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift, you have two options:
1. Using an operator.
2. Using Helm charts.
  
The preferred installation method depends on the type of environment 
you've chosen (e.g., demo environment or developer sandbox):

* If your OpenShift cluster has the **Operator Framework enabled**, 
    the operator-based installation is recommended.
* If your OpenShift cluster does **not** have the **Operator Framework enabled**,
    **or** if you **require more fine-grained control**, the Helm-based installation is 
    the better option.

## Step 2a: Install Red Hat Developer Hub through Helm Charts
* In order to do so, you can follow 
[this training exercise](https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:install-and-configure-red-hat-developer-hub-and-explore-templating-basics/resource/resources:install-red-hat-developer-hub-developer-sandbox).  
* In case you want to troubleshoot the installation, you can follow the instructions in
[this training exercise](https://developers.redhat.com/learn/deploying-and-troubleshooting-red-hat-developer-hub-openshift-practical-guide).

## Step 2b: Install Red Hat Developer Hub through the operator
In order to do so, you can follow 
[this training exercise](https://developers.redhat.com/learn/deploying-and-troubleshooting-red-hat-developer-hub-openshift-practical-guide).  
(Next to installation instructions, this training exercise contains a section with troubleshooting instructions as well).
